Use:

```
git config --global user.name "Philip Nye"
git config --global user.email "philipnye@users.noreply.github.com"
```

Note that the email address should be the privacy-defending email address associated with a GitHub account where this is in use (e.g. <user_name>@users.noreply.github.com), rather than the primary email address associated with that account.

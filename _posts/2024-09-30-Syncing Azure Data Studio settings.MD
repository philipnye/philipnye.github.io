As of version 1.49.1 at least, Azure Data Studio settings need to be synced manually - ADS doesn't include a built-in feature to sync settings across multiple devices.

Steps that need to be taken:
1. Copying JSON user settings
2. Manually installing extensions
3. Copying keyboard shortcuts
4. Copying SQL user snippets

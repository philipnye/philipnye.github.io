Putting an exclamation mark before a filename excludes that file from being ignored.

```
!file1.py
```

But where an entire directory is being ignored, this exclusion won't work. I.e. for:

```
my-app/
  └── .gitignore
  └── directory/
        └── file1.py
```

the following won't work successfully:

```
directory

!file1.py
```

Instead we need to _exclude all files in the directory_ (rather than ignoring the directory itself) using an asterisk - then our exception will work:

```
directory/*

!file1.py
```

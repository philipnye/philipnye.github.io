# Two-factor fixed effects regressions
These can be useful to start to dig more into causality by focusing on changes in the independent and dependent variables - as this should strip out the effect of unchanging characteristics of the entities being studied.

Of the options produced by `linearmodels`, use the `R-squared (Within)` value and the p-value for the `F-statistic (robust)`. [Ref.](https://chatgpt.com/share/68fb8d0a-69c0-8009-b5e0-fa4ea877fa6c)
